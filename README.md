**Objective:**  
Develop a dynamic and interactive React web application to visualize and manage data for the European Football Championship. The application processes and displays data from multiple CSV files, providing users with a detailed overview of the tournament, including match details, team statistics, and progression through various stages, from group stages to knockout rounds.

## Algorithm

1. **Understand the Task:** Get a good understanding of the overall task before starting. Aim to see the big picture, then break it down into smaller parts.
2. **Visualize a Basic Design:** Think of a minimalist designâ€”just enough to get started. Even a rough drawing on paper helps keep the idea in front of me.
3. **Break Down the UI:** Divide the user interface into larger components to begin with.
4. **Build a Static Version:** Start by building a static version of the UI to realize where smaller, reusable components are needed.
5. **Basic Styling:** Apply simple CSS for basic colors and shapes.
6. **Set Up Routing:** Implement basic routing without parameters.
7. **Analyze Data:** Understand the structure of the data and manually create logic to parse it from CSV files.
8. **Add State:** Bring the components to life by adding state where needed.
9. **Sync Data:** Ensure data flows smoothly between the components.
10. **Refine the Code:** Look for opportunities to optimize and refactor the code.
11. **Complete the Styling:** Add full CSS styling to finalize the design.
